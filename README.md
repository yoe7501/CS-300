Project Reflection
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The project involved developing a course management program for ABCU's Computer Science department. The program needed to efficiently store, retrieve, and display course information, and allow users to search for specific courses and view their details and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem?

I evaluated different data structures—vector, hash table, and binary search tree (BST)—to determine the most efficient way to manage the course data. Understanding data structures is crucial because they optimize performance for specific tasks. I chose a linked list for its simplicity and ability to maintain an alphanumeric order of courses.

How did you overcome any roadblocks?

I tackled challenges by breaking down tasks into smaller steps and testing each feature thoroughly. When faced with complex issues, I researched best practices and applied feedback from earlier assignments to refine my approach.

How has this project expanded your approach to designing software?

This project has deepened my understanding of the importance of selecting the right data structure for specific needs. It emphasized the value of modular design, careful planning, and writing efficient, maintainable code.

How has this project evolved the way you write programs?

I've become more disciplined in using clear naming conventions, adding comments, and structuring code for readability and adaptability. The focus on best practices has shaped my approach to programming, ensuring my code is both professional and future-proof.
